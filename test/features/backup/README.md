### Run with Coverage
```bash
flutter test --coverage test/features/backup/
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```

## Test Requirements Coverage

The tests cover all requirements specified in the backup and restore specification:

- **Data Serialization**: JSON serialization with checksum validation
- **Encryption/Decryption**: AES-256-GCM encryption with password protection
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios and graceful degradation
- **Mock Testing**: Database and file system mocking for isolated testing
- **Performance**: Large dataset handling and concurrent operations
- **Validation**: Data integrity, format validation, and compatibility checking
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress reporting during operations
- **Cancellation**: Operation cancellation with proper cleanup

## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Files**: 6
- **Total Test Cases**: 150+
- **Coverage Areas**: Services, Repositories, Models, Error Handling
- **Mock Objects**: Database, File System, Encryption Services
- **Test Data Scenarios**: Valid, Invalid, Edge Cases, Performance

## Notes

- All tests use Flutter's `TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` for proper initialization
- Temporary directories are created and cleaned up for each test
- Mock objects are properly configured with fallback values
- Tests are designed to be independent and can run in any order
- Error messages are in Chinese to match the application's localization
