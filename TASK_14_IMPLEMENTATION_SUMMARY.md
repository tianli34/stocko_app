# Task 14: 添加数据验证和完整性检查 - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive data validation and integrity checking functionality for the backup and restore system.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Validation Service Interface (`i_validation_service.dart`)
- Defined comprehensive validation service interface
- Methods for format validation, version compatibility, data integrity, corruption detection, and pre-restore validation

### 2. Validation Models
- **ValidationResult**: Core validation result model with errors, warnings, and repair suggestions
- **IntegrityCheckResult**: Detailed integrity check results with statistics and relationship validation
- **CompatibilityCheckResult**: Version and compatibility check results

### 3. Validation Service Implementation (`validation_service.dart`)
Implemented all required validation features:

#### File Format Validation
- ✅ Backup file existence and accessibility checks
- ✅ JSON format validation
- ✅ Basic structure validation (metadata, tables)
- ✅ Encrypted file handling with password validation

#### Version Compatibility Checks
- ✅ Backup format version compatibility
- ✅ Database schema version compatibility
- ✅ Application version compatibility
- ✅ Table structure compatibility

#### Data Integrity Validation
- ✅ Checksum verification
- ✅ Record count validation
- ✅ Data relationship integrity checks
- ✅ Foreign key relationship validation
- ✅ Duplicate record detection
- ✅ Orphaned record identification

#### File Corruption Detection
- ✅ File structure integrity checks
- ✅ JSON corruption detection
- ✅ Metadata corruption detection
- ✅ Data consistency validation

#### Pre-Restore Validation
- ✅ Comprehensive pre-flight checks
- ✅ Table structure compatibility validation
- ✅ Data type compatibility checks
- ✅ Constraint validation
- ✅ Storage space estimation

### 4. Enhanced Restore Service Integration
- Updated RestoreService to use the new validation service
- Improved error handling and validation reporting
- Better compatibility checking in restore preview

### 5. Provider Integration
- Created validation service provider for dependency injection
- Updated restore service provider to include validation service

### 6. Test Coverage
- Created comprehensive test suite for validation service
- Tests for file format validation, corruption detection, and repair suggestions

## Key Features Implemented

### Data Validation
1. **File Format Validation**: Validates JSON structure, required fields, and data types
2. **Version Compatibility**: Checks backup format, schema, and app version compatibility
3. **Data Integrity**: Verifies checksums, record counts, and data relationships
4. **Corruption Detection**: Identifies file corruption and provides repair suggestions

### Integrity Checks
1. **Checksum Validation**: Ensures data hasn't been tampered with
2. **Relationship Integrity**: Validates foreign key relationships
3. **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies duplicate records
4. **Orphaned Record Detection**: Finds records with missing relationships

### Repair Suggestions
1. **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Provides specific repair recommendations based on error types
2. **Severity-Based Prioritization**: Categorizes issues by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
3. **Actionable Guidance**: Offers concrete steps to resolve validation issues

### Pre-Restore Validation
1. **Comprehensive Checks**: Validates all aspects before starting restore
2. **Table Structure Validation**: Ensures compatibility with current database schema
3. **Data Type Validation**: Checks data type compatibility
4. **Constraint Validation**: Validates database constraints

## Error Handling and User Experience
- Detailed error messages with specific error codes
- Severity-based error classification
- Comprehensive repair suggestions
- Progress tracking for long-running validations
- Graceful handling of edge cases

## Integration Points
- Seamlessly integrated with existing backup/restore workflow
- Enhanced restore preview with validation results
- Improved error reporting in backup service
- Compatible with existing encryption and database services

## Files Created/Modified
1. `lib/features/backup/domain/services/i_validation_service.dart` - New interface
2. `lib/features/backup/domain/models/validation_result.dart` - New model
3. `lib/features/backup/domain/models/integrity_check_result.dart` - New model
4. `lib/features/backup/domain/models/compatibility_check_result.dart` - New model
5. `lib/features/backup/data/services/validation_service.dart` - New implementation
6. `lib/features/backup/data/providers/validation_service_provider.dart` - New provider
7. `lib/features/backup/data/services/restore_service.dart` - Enhanced with validation
8. `lib/features/backup/data/providers/restore_service_provider.dart` - Updated provider
9. `test/features/backup/data/services/validation_service_test.dart` - New tests

## Requirements Fulfilled
- ✅ **2.2**: 实现备份文件格式验证和版本兼容性检查
- ✅ **5.1**: 添加数据关系完整性验证
- ✅ **5.2**: 实现备份文件损坏检测和修复建议
- ✅ **恢复前数据预检查功能**: 添加恢复前的数据预检查功能

## Next Steps
The validation system is now ready for integration with the UI components and can be extended with additional validation rules as needed. The modular design allows for easy addition of new validation types and error handling strategies.
